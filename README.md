     Our drawings, image-series, showcase our group’s utilization of a variety of artistic design elements. At the core, these drawings explore the effect of color relations, motion, and depth on the viewer’s eye.

            The picture plane of image-series can be easily separated into two categories: negative and positive space. The negative space of image-series can potentially consist of a variety of sizes and spacings of small white or black circles, creating a slight sense of disorganization. This variety of dots combined with the unified black or white backdrop combines to make a subtle yet interesting negative space. If the dots are black, the backdrop is white, but if the dots are white, the backdrop is black. These variations add a completely different way of looking at the image(s). The positive space is created by four straight colored lines and two arrays of circle(s) and/or triangle(s); this positive space is almost entirely created along the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, with a greater amount of positive space being created towards the bottom right of the drawing. This leaves the bottom-left and top-right spaces of the drawing filled with negative space. The result of these clearly defined regions is that the viewer’s eyes will naturally drift from the top-left down to the bottom right (or vice versa) due to the natural pull of the positive space.

            The natural pull that is created via the contrast of positive and negative space can also be understood in terms of lines, depth, and motion. Image-series consists of four clearly defined lines, each of which serves to interrupt the very white/black background. Thus, these four lines each draw the attention of the viewer due to their role in emphasizing positive space and separating negative spaces. Three of these lines (L1, L2, L3) are widely separated at the bottom-right of the picture plane, but join together at the top-left of the picture plane to form the fourth line (OL). At this point of union there is a supernova—a procedure used to make the transition between lines more interesting. The result of these lines all sharing a point of origin is an illusion of depth, as it appears that these three lines are moving farther into the picture, only to merge into a supernova and reappear as one singular line.  The shapes that make up the space between these three converging lines create a feeling of motion as well as depth. These circles and/or triangles progressively, almost rhythmically, scale down as they climb towards the top-left edge of the picture plane, but the overlapping nature of the shapes makes it look as if they are moving into the picture plane towards a point of origin (or moving away from that origin).

            The colors of the four lines that make up the drawing frame are dependent on complementary and analogous schemes. The OL and L2 are complements of each other. L2, L1, and L3 are pretty close to analogous to each other, with L1 corresponding to the color that is 36° counter-clockwise of the middle line’s color on the color wheel, while L3’s color corresponds to the color that is located 36° clockwise of the middle line’s color. The color of the shapes is determined by finding the color that is 90° degrees clockwise from the OL’s color, while the color of the supernova is the color that is 270° from the O
